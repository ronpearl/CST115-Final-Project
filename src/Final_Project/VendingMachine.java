/**
 * 	Program:	Vending Machine
 * 	Author:		Ronald Pearl
 * 	Summary:	Final Project for CST-115 class
 * 	Date:		8/8/16 - 9/25/16
 * 	Description:
 * 		You will create an application that models a vending machine. The vending machine 
 * 		will have two types of users – a customer, who will be able to select a product, 
 * 		and a BOSS, who will be able to maintain the collection of products in the machine.  
 * 		The machine itself will have a graphical interface that displays the available 
 * 		products and allows the user to make selections. The BOSS will have a separate 
 * 		interface that provides a variety of maintenance options.  The machine will 
 * 		provide a means of alternating between the two types of users.
